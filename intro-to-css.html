            <p>Generally speaking, we stay away from style attributes. They are hard to maintain, they mix structure and style, it's very difficult to write lists of them, they add to your work as a designer, and they make your html hard to read.</p>

            <h2>Embedded Stylesheets</h2>
            <p>Notice that the h2 selector in our embedded stylesheet is not changing the text-decoration on the h2 with the style attribute. This is because the style attribute has higher specificity than the embedded style element.</p>

            <h2>External Stylesheets</h2>
            <p>External stylesheets are the industry standard. They are the most maintainable and can be used to unify the look and feel of a large application while allowing you to change the look across an entire app with a change in one place in one stylesheet. It does have lower specificity than embedded stylesheets and style attributes.</p>
