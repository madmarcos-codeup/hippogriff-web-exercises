/*
make dice.js

hook it up to an html file

test it

now move randomNumber to a separate file
export randomNumber
import in dice.js  (LET INTELLIJ DO IT FOR US AND ADD THE .js)

try to test it

how to fix?

    script tag type="module"
test it

create a variable called randomNumber
name collision
change the function name on import to randomNum

don't forget the ".js" at the end of the import statement
see if you can get intellij to create the import for you
    to demonstrate

-------------------

    make dice-roller.js that will roll the dice and then set vals in DOM elements

export roll1d6 and roll1d20

import them in dice-roller.js
can use a wild card for import instead

use them and set vals in the html
don't forget type="module" for dice-roller.js
