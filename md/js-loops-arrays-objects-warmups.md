/**

 *

 * Create a function named removeABC that will remove the letters "a", "b" and "c" from the given string and return the modified version. If the given string does not contain "a", "b", or "c", return null.
 *
 * Examples
 * >> removeABC("This might be a bit hard") ➞ "This might e  it hrd"
 * >> removeABC("hello world!") ➞ null
 * >> removeABC("") ➞ null
 *
 * Notes
 * If the given string does not contain "a", "b", or "c", return null.

 *
 * Examples
 *
 * >> reverseOdd("Bananas") ➞ "sananaB"
 * >> reverseOdd("One two three four") ➞ "enO owt eerht four"
 * >> reverseOdd("Make sure uoy only esrever sdrow of ddo length") ➞ "Make sure you only reverse words of odd length"
 *
 * Notes
 * There is exactly one space between each word and no punctuation is used.
 * Should work with empty string.
 * Should work with only one word.

/**
 * TODO:
 * Convert a Number to Base-2
 * Create a function named binary that returns a base-2 (binary) representation of a base-10 (decimal) string number. To convert is simple: ((2) means base-2 and (10) means base-10) 010101001(2) = 1 + 8 + 32 + 128.
 *
 * Going from right to left, the value of the most right bit is 1, now from that every bit to the left will be x2 the value, value of an 8 bit binary numbers are (256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1).
 *
 * Examples
 * >> binary(1) ➞ "1"   // 1*1 = 1
 * >> binary(5) ➞ "101"   // 1*1 + 1*4 = 5
 * >> binary(10) ➞ "1010"   // 1*2 + 1*8 = 10
 *
 * Notes
 * Numbers will always be below 1024 (not including 1024).
 * The && operator could be useful.
 * The strings will always go to the length at which the most left bit's value gets bigger than the number in decimal.
 * If a binary conversion for 0 is attempted, return "0".
